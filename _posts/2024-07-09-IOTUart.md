## Overview

Ever wonder what's under the hood of many of your IoT devices? It's probably some form of Linux! In this article, I will show you how to get a shell within a router using a Bus Pirate and a UART connection. For this demonstration, I will be using the Netgear WNR1000v3.

## Getting Started

To get started, you will need a way to communicate over UART, there are several ways of doing this but I will be using the Bus Pirate from Dangerous Prototypes:

> "The Bus Pirate is an open source hacker multi-tool that talks to electronic stuff. It's got a bunch of features an intrepid hacker might need to prototype their next project" - http://dangerousprototypes.com/docs/Bus_Pirate

You can pick one up from sparkfun for around $32: https://www.sparkfun.com/products/12942

## Overview of the board

### Front 
On the front of the board we can see:
* Broadcom BCM5356A1 CPU
* SDRAM
* 6 Pin header for our UART Connection

### Back
On the back of the board we can see:

* Macronix MX25L3205DM2I-12G (Flash Chip)



## UART Connection
UART has three components that allows it to communicate:

### TX (Transmit)
Is responsible for transmitting the data and is connected to the RX pin.
### RX (Receive)
Is responsible for Receiving the data and is connected to the TX pin.
### GND (Ground)
Provides a common reference voltage level for both the transmitting and receiving devices

Sometimes, we have to figure out where each of these pins are located within the header but thankfully OPENWRT has done this for us: 
> "Attach 3,3V Serial UART Adapter to J3 on the PCB. Pin 6=GND, Pin 2=RXD, Pin 5=TXD. J3 Connector is not soldered in by default. Standard UART speed 115200 Baud. " - https://openwrt.org/toh/netgear/wnr1000_v3

We can see this below:

To connect our Bus Pirate, like mentioned earlier, we have to remember that the TX (Transmit) is connected to the RX (Receive) as shown below:

To make these connections for your Bus Pirate, you can follow this diagram provided by [Sparkfun](https://learn.sparkfun.com/tutorials/bus-pirate-v36a-hookup-guide/all):

Once this is all connected it should look something like this (Don't mind the messy soldering):
