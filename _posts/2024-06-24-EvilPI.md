title: "EvilPI: Using a Raspberry Pi as an Agent into an Internal Network"
excerpt: "Ever thought of using a Raspberry Pi as an agent for pentesting within an internal network? In this project, we explore how to set up a lightweight tool called Ligolo-ng on a Raspberry Pi. By routing through a cloud instance, you can leverage your at-home Kali machine for effective penetration testing. This guide walks you through the steps of setting up the agent and proxy, establishing secure SSH tunnels, and configuring your devices for seamless connectivity. Perfect for anyone looking to expand their pentesting toolkit with a cost-effective and portable solution."

## Background

While doing some of the Pro-labs for HTB, I recently discovered [ligolo-ng](https://github.com/Nicocha30/ligolo-ng).

> **Ligolo-ng** is a *simple*, *lightweight*, and *fast* tool that allows pentesters to establish tunnels from a reverse TCP/TLS connection using a **tun interface** (without the need for SOCKS).   

The program is really cool and easy to use. It allows you to tunnel into the infected device similar to a VPN. This allows attackers to get around tools like ProxyChains and can help speed up tools like Nmap.

I thought it might be a neat little project to get a lightweight tool like this one running on a Raspberry Pi. We can then route through a cloud instance and use our at-home Kali machine.

This would be useful if you needed to put a machine on an internal network for pentesting.

## Getting Started

In this project, I will be using a [Raspberry Pi 4](https://www.raspberrypi.com/products/raspberry-pi-4-model-b/) (4GB) running Debian and a Linode container.

Ligolo-ng is built using an agent and a proxy. For the Raspberry Pi, you will want to pick up a copy of the agent:
https://github.com/nicocha30/ligolo-ng/releases/tag/v0.6.1

## Testing on Pi

I'm going to pick up a copy for my Pi by running:

    $ wget https://github.com/nicocha30/ligolo-ng/releases/download/v0.6.1/ligolo-ng_agent_0.6.1_linux_armv7.tar.gz
    $ tar xf ./ligolo-ng_agent_0.6.1_linux_armv7.tar.gz
    $ chmod +x agent

We now have to download the proxy with the following:

    $ wget https://github.com/nicocha30/ligolo-ng/releases/download/v0.6.1/ligolo-ng_proxy_0.6.1_linux_amd64.tar.gz
    $ tar xf ./ligolo-ng_proxy_0.6.1_linux_amd64.tar.gz

To start my proxy server I will run:

    $ ./proxy -selfcert

To test my Pi's connection back to my PC I will run:

    $ ./agent -connect 192.168.254.147:11601 -ignore-cert 

We can now see the connection made by the Pi:

## Using the Cloud

Since our attacker machine will sit behind a firewall, we need a way to ensure that the agent can route to a cloud instance.

To make it easy and secure, we are going to route the Ligolo-ng through an SSH tunnel.

### Raspberry Pi:

I created a script that will automatically create this service for you. You can find it at:
https://github.com/Cleck777/PI-Ligolo-ng-Service-Starter

The main component of this script is:

     $ autossh -M 20000 -N -T -L 11601:127.0.0.1:11601 {SSH_USER}@{HOSTNAME} -i {IDENTITY_FILE}

This will forward your local port (default: 11601) to the remote server.

You can now start the agent:

     $ /usr/bin/agent -connect localhost:11601 -ignore-cert

### Attacker Machine

First, you have to start a remote port forward to your local ligolo-ng proxy:

     $ ssh -R 11601:127.0.0.1:11601 {SSH_USER}@{HOSTNAME} -i {IDENTITY_FILE}

You can now start the proxy:

     $ ./proxy -selfcert

As we can see, we get a connection from our Raspberry Pi.

Type `session` and choose your session.

Now we need to create our interface:

     $ sudo ip tuntap add user [your_username] mode tun ligolo
     $ sudo ip link set ligolo up

We can now set up our route as normal:

    $ sudo ip route add 192.168.0.0/24 dev ligolo

You can now start your agent by typing:

     $ [Agent : root@raspberrypi] Â» start

And you're good to go!
