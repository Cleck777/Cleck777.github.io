## Background

While doing some of the Pro-labs for HTB I recently discovered [ligolo-ng](https://github.com/Nicocha30/ligolo-ng) 

> **Ligolo-ng** is a *simple*, *lightweight* and *fast* tool that allows pentesters to establish
tunnels from a reverse TCP/TLS connection using a **tun interface** (without the need of SOCKS).   

The program is really cool and easy to use. It allows you to tunnel into the infected device similar to a VPN. This allows attackers to get around tools like ProxyChains and can help speed up tools like Nmap.

I thought it might be a neat little project to get a lightweight tool like this one running on a Raspberry Pi. We can then route through a cloud instance and use our at-home Kali machine.

This would be useful if you needed to put a machine on internal network for pentesting.


## Getting Started

In this project, I will be using a [Rasberry PI 4](https://www.raspberrypi.com/products/raspberry-pi-4-model-b/) (4GB) running debian and a linode container. 


Ligolo-ng is built using an agent and a proxy. For the Rasberry PI, you are going to want to pick up a copy of the agent:
https://github.com/nicocha30/ligolo-ng/releases/tag/v0.6.1

## Testing on PI
I'm going to pick up a copy for my PI by running:

    $ wget https://github.com/nicocha30/ligolo-ng/releases/download/v0.6.1/ligolo-ng_agent_0.6.1_linux_armv7.tar.gz
    $ tar xf ./ligolo-ng_agent_0.6.1_linux_armv7.tar.gz
    $ chmod +x agent


We now have to download the proxy with the following:

    $ wget https://github.com/nicocha30/ligolo-ng/releases/download/v0.6.1/ligolo-ng_proxy_0.6.1_linux_amd64.tar.gz
    $ tar xf ./ligolo-ng_proxy_0.6.1

To start my proxy server I will run 

    $ ./proxy -selfcert

To test my PI's connection back to my PC I will run 
    
    $ ./agent -connect 192.168.254.147:11601 -ignore-cert 

We can now see connection made by the by the PI:

## Using the cloud

Since our attacker machine will sit behind a firewall, we need a way to ensure that the agent can route to to a cloud instance.

To make it easy and secure, We are going to route the Ligolo-ng through a ssh tunnel.

### Rasberry PI:
I created a script that will automtically create this service for you. You can find it at:
https://github.com/Cleck777/PI-Ligolo-ng-Service-Starte

The main component of this script is:

     $ autossh -M 20000 -N -T -L 11601:127.0.0.1:11601 {SSH_USER}@{HOSTNAME} -i {IDENTITY_FILE}

This will foward your your local port (default: 11601) to the remote server.
 
You can now start the agent:
     
     $ /usr/bin/agent -connect localhost:11601 -ignore-cert

### Attacker Machine

First you have to start a remote port foward to your local ligolo-ng proxy:

     $ ssh -R 11601:127.0.0.1:11601 {SSH_USER}@{HOSTNAME} -i {IDENTITY_FILE}

You can now start the proxy:

     $ ./proxy -selfcert

As we can see we get a connection from our Rasberry PI.

Type session and choose your session

Now we need to create our interface:

     $ sudo ip tuntap add user [your_username] mode tun ligolo
     $ sudo ip link set ligolo up


We can now set up our route as normal:

    $ sudo ip route add 192.168.0.0/24 dev ligolo
  
you can now start your agentby typing:

     $ [Agent : root@raspberrypi] » start

And your good to go!
