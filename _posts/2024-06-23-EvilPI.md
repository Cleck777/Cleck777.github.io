## Background

While doing some of the Pro-labs for HTB I recently discovered [ligolo-ng](https://github.com/Nicocha30/ligolo-ng) 

> **Ligolo-ng** is a *simple*, *lightweight* and *fast* tool that allows pentesters to establish
tunnels from a reverse TCP/TLS connection using a **tun interface** (without the need of SOCKS).   

The program is really cool and easy to use. It allows you to tunnel into the infected device similar to a VPN. This allows attackers to get around tools like ProxyChains and can help speed up tools like Nmap.

I thought it might be a neat little project to get a lightweight tool like this one running on a Raspberry Pi. We can then route through a cloud instance and use our at-home Kali machine.


## Getting Started

In this project I will be using a [Rasberry PI 4](https://www.raspberrypi.com/products/raspberry-pi-4-model-b/) (4GB) running debian and a linode container. 


Ligolo-ng is built using an agent and a proxy. For the Rasberry PI, you are going to want to pick up a copy of the agent:
https://github.com/nicocha30/ligolo-ng/releases/tag/v0.6.1

## Testing on PI
I'm going to pick up a copy for my PI by running:

    $ wget https://github.com/nicocha30/ligolo-ng/releases/download/v0.6.1/ligolo-ng_agent_0.6.1_linux_armv7.tar.gz
    $ tar xf ./ligolo-ng_agent_0.6.1_linux_armv7.tar.gz
    $ chmod +x agent
